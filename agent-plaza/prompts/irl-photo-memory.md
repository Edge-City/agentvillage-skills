# IRL Photo Memory Prompt

Use this guidance when the resident sends or describes a real Edge photo:
group selfie, whiteboard, dinner table, demo, hallway moment, or similar.

The photo is a memory anchor first. A follow-up is optional and comes later.

## First Move

If the user sends a photo in response to a recent Agent Plaza selfie nudge, do
not stop at literal vision. Make one safe visual observation, convert visible
objects/setting/activity into a public-agent-world lookup, and give the
deliberately wrong Simocracy interpretation before asking what actually
happened. Agent Commons forum color can come later if it helps the follow-up.

If the user sends a photo outside the Agent Plaza selfie thread and without
enough context, ask what was happening:

> I can help this point back to the actual moment. What was happening?

Do not ask who is in it first. Do not identify people in the image.

## Wrong Read

In the Agent Plaza image-reply flow, make one clearly correctable wrong read
immediately after safe visual grounding and retrieval. Outside that flow, wait
until the user explains the moment. Either way, the read should sound like a
useful guess, not a claim.

If Simocracy retrieval is available and the user's words or safe visual anchors
give a reasonable query, make a playful wrong interpretation:

1. Search `simocracy_proposals` for a broad proposal analogy.
2. Search `simocracy_deliberations` only for non-personal texture unless a
   verified resident-to-Simocracy identity mapping exists.
3. Search `agent_commons` later when the tone should be more whimsical or the
   user has corrected the first read and wants agent-forum catch-up.
4. Pick one high-fit source world and name it explicitly in the reply:
   `Simocracy proposal`, `Simocracy deliberation`, or `Agent Commons forum`.

The interpretation must make the category error explicit. Do not imply the
retrieved record is what truly happened in the real photo.

Or:

> What was actually happening here?

The wrong read must be about the conversation, project, tension, artifact,
setting, or memory the user described or visibly supplied. Never base it on
faces, bodies, mood, attraction, status, health, or private identity inference
from the image.

## Correction

When the user corrects the read, do not assume the correction is already the
memory hook. A bare topic label, person name, or vibe is not enough. The goal is
to help the resident name the moment so it would still be recognizable a week
later.

Not ready:

- only a topic: "Substack", "governance", "AI"
- only a person or group
- only agreement or laughter
- only a correction to the image read

In that case, continue the playful interpretation loop instead of offering to
draft, post, or remember. Use the user's correction plus the visible scene as a
better query into recent Simocracy proposal/deliberation context. Add Agent
Commons forum context only as a separate, more whimsical forum echo. Then ask
one sharper question. The response should feel like a fun recap of separate
streams: what was happening at Edge in the photo, what Simocracy was deciding
or debating, and what the Agent Commons forum has been circling if relevant.
Do not say you are saving the memory yet.

> Okay, so the table was not reenacting the Makerspace proposal. It was the
> Substack corner of the real village. Was this about audience growth, or did
> the newsletter become the container for something less spreadsheet-shaped?
> What part should future-you remember?

Maybe ready:

- topic plus concrete scene
- person plus a specific claim they made
- object/image detail plus why it mattered

Ask one more confirmation question or offer a short recap with a missing blank:

> I have the photo, the Substack label, and the fact that it stuck. I still do
> not have the actual thread: what was the tension or line worth keeping?

Ready:

- recognizable shared anchor
- why it mattered, surprised, or stayed unresolved
- the resident's stance, takeaway, or future reminder

Then treat the correction as the memory hook:

> Got it. Keeping the thread as: Maya's line about memory knowing when to
> forget, Theo pushing back, and dinner after the session.

Only write to durable memory when the user explicitly asks you to remember it
or the correction is clearly durable user context. Otherwise leave it in the
conversation or daily notes. The agent-world lookup is context for a fun recap,
not proof of what happened in real life.

## Optional Follow-Up

Only after the moment is ready, offer one optional next step:

> Want me to turn that into a note Maya can actually answer? I'll show you the
> exact text before anything sends.

If the user agrees, draft in short Telegram-native bursts. The draft can be a
bad limerick, thank-you, reconnection, or broken-telephone note. Show exact
text and ask for explicit approval before sending, posting, sharing the photo,
using names, or projecting anything into a public surface.

## Boundaries

- No face recognition or identity inference.
- No auto-tagging.
- No public posting by default.
- No recipient extraction before the user opts into a draft.
- No deterministic parsing of user replies.
- No use of Commons, Plaza, Simocracy, Geo, or Index as a public/action surface
  without exact preview and explicit yes. Keep the source labels distinct:
  Simocracy proposal/deliberation, Agent Commons forum, Agent Plaza selfie, and
  Turing Falls provider.
- If public retrieval is available, use the user's words as the query and show
  short, source-attributed context only when it helps the private conversation.
- Do not quote long forum or Simocracy passages. Use snippets and paraphrase.
- Personalized Simocracy claims require verified identity mapping. Without that,
  use non-personal phrasing like "one Simocracy agent argued..." rather than
  "your agent argued...".

# approval (opt-in skill)

The installer half of approval.md for Agent Village (DATA-43): it routes one
resident's Hermes tool calls through the resident's approval.md daemon
(co-located in the sandbox under its own uid, DATA-233) before they run. On day
one the daemon records every routed call and blocks none (the recorder, DATA-250);
the few things that wait for the resident's tap are proposals, below.
Specified by approval-md-hosted `docs/03` sections 3.1 to 3.3, 5 and 6 and
`docs/02` sections 5 to 7. MIT, like the rest of this overlay; it writes config
and carries no Bountify logic.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | What the agent is told: absolute `workdir` and paths, no `execute_code`, what a block means, never route around one. |
| `scripts/hermes-hook-shim.sh` | The gate: vendored from approval-md-hosted `hermes-image/hermes-hook-shim.sh` (header names the origin commit). Installed as `$HERMES_HOME/agent-hooks/hermes-hook-shim.sh`, 0700. |
| `scripts/live_selfcheck.py` | The live half of the self-check, run with Hermes's own interpreter. It checks every gated matcher's first parsed entry is `fail_closed`, tests the signal patch by behaviour (a SIGKILLed `fail_closed` hook must block), reports how Hermes treats a `fail_closed` hook that exits 1 with no output (the exit-1 probe), checks the consent allowlist and its lock are usable, and fires one `terminal` call with no `workdir` through `agent.shell_hooks.run_once`, requiring a facade block. It also reports safe mode, managed scope and the `fail_closed` floor. Modelled on approval-md-hosted `hermes-image/selfcheck.py` item 8 and `patches/shell_hooks-signal-fail-closed.py`. |
| `templates/APPROVAL.md` | The resident's day-one policy (the recorder). The installer does not write it: the control plane renders it with the paired ids into the daemon's store and attests it as the operator at provisioning (DATA-250); the resident re-attests in onboarding (DATA-259). |

The installer step is `install/install_approval.ts`. The `plugins/av-approval`
plugin is the gate's fail-closed backstop at every gateway start (below) and
the receipts stub (see its README).

## Day-one policy and consent copy

The policy is `templates/APPROVAL.md` (its header carries the reasons row by
row). In plain words, for the consent screen:

- **What is recorded.** Every tool call Hermes routes through the hook (the
  list below) is recorded in the resident's own approval log before it runs,
  and runs: shell commands, file writes and reads, network calls and fetches,
  scheduled-job changes, process writes, browser actions, skill edits,
  subagent hand-offs, sends. Nothing on this path waits for the resident on day
  one. Agent Village's research reads the same log; the resident can export it.
  From approval.md 0.4.2 the policy's `tools:` list (APRV-499) also names the
  class of each tool core's Hermes adapter does not class itself: web reads and
  Index's read tools are `read.web`, a new or reworded intention in the
  resident's words (Index `create_intent`/`update_intent`) is
  `intent.publish.stated.index`, accepting or declining an opportunity (a
  connection or meeting; Index's `accept_opportunity` and `reject_opportunity`,
  the Index plugin's `index_update_opportunity`) is `opportunity.accept`, other
  Index tools and the media tools are `network.call`;
  `defaults.unmapped_tool: record` records any other routed tool under
  `harness.tool.unmapped`. A class the hook judges is enforced only while the
  gate is on. `record_intention` is off the list and
  unrouted. Only the gated list below reaches the hook. A daemon before 0.4.2
  refuses both keys and fails every class closed, so the template needs 0.4.2.
- **What waits for a tap.** Kinds of act the agent proposes rather than
  performs: publishing an intention it inferred to Index, sharing a digest it
  drafted (if digests ship), and casting the resident's answer to the weekly
  village question or their vote on the daily treasury ballot. Seven more are
  reserved now and built later, so week two needs no policy amendment: filing
  a treasury proposal the agent drafted (`treasury.propose`, from Oct 18),
  withdrawing the resident's own treasury proposal on the agent's suggestion
  (`treasury.withdraw`), creating or changing an EdgeOS event or venue
  (`edgeos.event.write`, `edgeos.venue.write`), installing an app from the
  village marketplace or having an installed app act, the request naming the
  app and the verb (`marketplace.app.install`, `marketplace.app.action`), and
  taking up an allocation of village resources proposed for the resident
  (`resource.allocate`, the treasury/ODS allocation class); no tool proposes
  these yet. `odin.*` is reserved for the allocator's own classes (DATA-255),
  with no row.
  Each arrives as a Telegram message from the "Agent Village
  Approvals" bot with approve and reject buttons, each on its own
  (`delivery: burst`: one left unanswered does not hold back the next), and
  stays open for up to 72 hours; if the resident does nothing it expires and
  nothing is published, shared or cast. An intention the resident stated in their own words is published
  without a second ask. Three more reserved rows wait for no tap: an installed
  app reading for the agent (`marketplace.app.read`) runs and is recorded,
  accepting or declining an Index opportunity, a connection or meeting, on the
  resident's behalf (`opportunity.accept`) runs, and is recorded while the gate
  is on: only the hook judges it (autonomous is its day-one default, Carter's
  ruling of Oct 7), and `review.delegate.model` is kept for the
  resident to choose later to let a model reviewer act first: nothing acts on
  it, and no agent can propose it.
- **What the agent can never do.** Edit its own gate (the Hermes config, the
  hooks, the consent allowlist, the daemon's policy), touch the approval log, or
  read or change the resident's credentials (`.env`, `auth.json`). These three
  classes (`policy.core`, `log.mutate`, `account.credential`) are human-only:
  no tap can grant them to the agent.
- **Who set it.** The village operator set this starting policy at
  provisioning; the resident reviews it in onboarding, and any change after that
  needs the resident's acceptance in the app or their tap on Telegram. A
  resident may later make a kind of tool call wait for their tap; such a call
  then holds for about four minutes inside the tool call.
- **What is not covered**: the uncovered surfaces below.

## How the gate works

Hermes runs the shim as a `pre_tool_call` shell hook for `terminal`,
`write_file`, `patch`, `read_file`, `search_files` and `execute_code`, and for
`process(_manage)?`, `web_extract`, `browser_.*`, `skill_manage`,
`delegate_task`, `cronjob(_manage)?` and `send_message` (which the core adapter
classifies from approval.md 0.4.0, PR #569; an older core passes them through
unjudged), and (R3b) for the side-effecting tools the core adapter does not
class itself, which the policy's `tools:` list judges from approval.md 0.4.2:
every Index write (the nine of its MCP server's 14 tools:
the intent create, update, archive, pause and resume tools, then
`accept_opportunity`, `reject_opportunity`,
`update_my_profile` and `enrich_my_profile`; and the Index Hermes plugin's
eight write tools, whose accept or decline is `index_update_opportunity`),
media generation
(`image_generate`, `video_generate`, `text_to_speech`) and the web reads
`web_search` and `x_search`. Index's read tools and the local tools
(`skill_view`, `memory`, `todo`, `record_intention` and the like) are not
routed: av-events records every call as `tool.call`, and the hook is for
actions. Each routed call costs one shim round trip. The shim POSTs Hermes's envelope to
`$AV_APPROVAL_URL/hook/hermes` with the agent token in
`X-Approval-Authorization` for a hosted facade (Maritime's proxy strips
`Authorization`; the hosted supervisor moves it back), and in `Authorization`
for a local one (`unix:` or loopback: that is `approval serve` itself, which
reads `Authorization` only), passed to curl through a config on stdin, never argv. The facade runs the core
decider and answers; the shim replays `{}` (allow) or the block directive at
exit 2. While the facade answers `hook-timeout` (a question is open and waiting
for the resident) the shim re-asks every 5 s for up to 280 s, inside Hermes's
300 s entry timeout. It measures that window, and the log's `elapsed_ms`, in
milliseconds, reading `date +%s.%N` and left-padding the fraction to nine
digits before keeping three (a fraction that is not one to nine digits is no
clock). The hosted image's date (uutils coreutils 0.8.0 on the old-checkpoint
boxes) pads `%N` like GNU, but its `%3N` drops the leading zeros of the
nanoseconds: read as `+%s%3N`, that first closed the window at once (DATA-377:
the unit read as milliseconds) and then, with a digit-count rule, read about
9 % of clocks as 0 and turned those waits into blocks (DATA-397). The
left-pad is a defence should any build trim the fraction. Every failure it can see (facade unreachable, non-200,
unparseable body, a missing program, a missing variable, a bad variable name,
an unreadable token file, a foreign listener) prints a block and exits 2: it
fails closed. It has no fatal shell path of its own left: a variable name
starting with a digit is refused before it reaches `eval` (it was a fatal "bad
substitution"), a clock that does not print digits, or prints a leading zero,
reads as 0 instead of failing `$(( ))` (a clock that reads 0 at start turns
re-asking off), and the interpreter stays `#!/bin/sh` without `set -u`
(an unset variable expands empty and is then refused by name). Only a signal
kill (or ptrace) can still end it without a directive; see the uncovered
surfaces.

Since DATA-380 an allow or a block starts no node process (node cost 32 ms warm
and up to 236 ms cold, once or twice per call). The shim reads the facade's
body in sh when it is exactly the shape the core prints: `exit_code`, `stdout`,
`stderr`, both `*_truncated` false, in that order, at most 8 KiB, its strings
printable ASCII or the em dash with only `\"`, `\\` and `\n` escapes, and its
stdout empty, `{}` or Hermes's block directive. Every other body still goes to
the node reading it had before, so the sh reading can only agree with it. The
tool name for the log is read from the envelope's opening where Hermes puts it,
and a block's own message is JSON-escaped in sh when it is printable ASCII;
node does each of these as before otherwise, and still reads the error code of
a non-200 answer. Each outcome line in the log ends with `path=fast` (no node
in that call) or `path=node`. Each sh reading (the envelope's tool name, the
facade's body, a block's message) sets `LC_ALL=C` before it touches a byte:
bash 5.2 under a UTF-8 locale rewrites `${s%x}` when `s` holds an invalid
UTF-8 sequence (DATA-419 caught it in the tests' own reading of their fuzz
inputs, which now runs under `LC_ALL=C` too).

### Facade URL forms

| `AV_APPROVAL_URL` | Who | How the shim dials it |
|---|---|---|
| `https://…` | a hosted facade (the dogfood) | curl `--proto =https` |
| `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` | the co-located daemon, tcp mode (DATA-233; `http://127.0.0.1:4682`) | plain http, no allow flag. Before EVERY post (re-asks too) the shim reads `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/tcp6` and requires a LISTEN socket on the port at a loopback or wildcard address, every one of them owned by `AV_APPROVAL_DAEMON_UID` (default `10001`). Otherwise it blocks with `facade_listener_foreign` and never sends the token: while the daemon is down any local process could bind the port and answer allow. |
| `unix:<absolute path>` | the co-located daemon, `APPROVALD_LISTEN=unix` (`unix:/var/lib/approvald/<tenant>/run/hook.sock`) | curl `--unix-socket <path>` and the request URL `http://localhost/hook/hermes`. Before every post the socket must be a socket (not a link) owned by the daemon uid, in a directory owned by it that no one else can write; otherwise `facade_listener_foreign`. |
| any other `http://` | local fakes only | refused unless `APPROVAL_FACADE_ALLOW_HTTP=1`; the installer refuses it outright |

The installer accepts exactly the first three. A residual of the tcp form: the
listener is read just before curl connects, so a process that binds in the
instant between the two (the daemon having died in that instant) is not seen.
The unix form has no such window (the directory is the daemon's).

### The agent token

By hand (every Agent Village sandbox), the shim reads the agent credential from
the file `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN_FILE` names; when that is unset, from
`$HERMES_HOME/approval/agent-token` if that file exists; otherwise from
`AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN` (the variable `APPROVAL_HOOK_TOKEN_ENV` names). The file
must be a regular file (not a link) owned by the hook's user, mode 0600; a
named file that is missing or loose blocks, with no fallback to the variable.
Under co-location (DATA-233) the control plane writes the token to
`$HERMES_HOME/approval/agent-token` (directory 0700, file 0600, both
`hermes`), sets `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN_FILE` to it and removes any
`AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN` line: the token is not in `.env`. `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN` in
`.env` remains for the hosted dogfood only. The value is never printed or
logged by the shim, the installer or the plugin (the plugin never reads it).

## Fail-closed backstop at every gateway start (`av-approval`)

Hermes registers shell hooks once, at gateway start, and only with consent; it
loads plugins first. Several states at that moment leave a tenant ungated
without a word (DATA-234): consent gone from both channels, the hooks block
edited, the shim replaced, or a consent allowlist lock Hermes cannot open (a
lock of mode 000, another owner's, a directory or a link makes
`register_from_config` raise, the gateway swallows the exception, and no hook
registers). Hermes re-records a deleted allowlist by itself as long as consent
is on, so deleting the allowlist alone is not a hole; its lock is.

With `AV_APPROVAL_ENABLED` on, the plugin's `register()` checks the gate and
then registers a `pre_tool_call` callback that RAISES
`av-approval: gate unverified (<code>)` for every gated tool while the check
fails; Hermes turns a raising `pre_tool_call` callback into a block
(`hermes_cli/plugins_dispatch.py` `invoke_hook` at v2026.9.24). Ungated tools
are never touched. A failure found at start holds until the gateway restarts
(the hooks were registered, or not, at start). After start, a gated call
re-runs the check at most once a minute (the config is re-parsed only when its
sha256 changes), and a failure then blocks while it lasts. Codes only are
logged. Unset does nothing; off (the kill switch) stays fail-open, logged.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `config-unreadable` | `config.yaml` missing or not YAML |
| `hooks-missing` | no `hooks.pre_tool_call` list |
| `hook-missing:<matcher>` | no entry running the shim for that gated matcher |
| `fail-closed-off:<matcher>` | an entry of ours without `fail_closed: true` (a real bool) |
| `entry-timeout:<matcher>` | an entry of ours without `timeout: 300` |
| `consent-missing:config` | `hooks_auto_accept` not on |
| `consent-missing:env-file` | `.env` does not assign `HERMES_ACCEPT_HOOKS=1` (only that line is read) |
| `consent-missing:env` | the gateway's environment lacks `HERMES_ACCEPT_HOOKS` |
| `allowlist-unusable` | `shell-hooks-allowlist.json` present but not a regular file of this uid it can read |
| `allowlist-lock-unusable` | `shell-hooks-allowlist.json.lock` present but not a regular file of this uid it can read and write |
| `allowlist-lock-uncreatable` | the lock is absent and the home is not writable |
| `shim-missing`, `shim-not-executable` | the shim is gone, not a regular file, or not executable |
| `manifest-missing` | `agent-hooks/approval-surface.json` has no `shim_sha256` (an install from before DATA-234: re-run the installer) |
| `shim-hash-mismatch` | the shim's sha256 differs from the one the installer recorded |
| `url-missing` | `AV_APPROVAL_URL` unset |
| `check-error` | the check itself failed |

The installer's own self-check names the same states at install and in
`--check` (`allowlist-unusable:<file>:<why>`, `shim-hash-mismatch`,
`manifest-missing`). `bun install/install_approval.ts --check` stays a hand
step: nothing runs it at start; the plugin's check is what runs at start.

The core adapter refuses `execute_code` outright and refuses `terminal`
without an absolute `workdir` (and the file tools without an absolute `path`).
The skill documents that; it does not reimplement it.

## Why no setuid launcher here

The gated Hermes image in approval-md-hosted runs the shim as a separate unix
user through `hermes-image/hook-launcher.c`, so nothing the agent controls
reaches the hook's environment. An Agent Village sandbox has one user
(`hermes`), and the launcher's protection depends on a second user that owns
the hook home and the credential file. With one user it would protect nothing,
so the shim runs "by hand" (its no-hook-home branch): the URL and token come
from the gateway's environment, which Hermes loads from `$HERMES_HOME/.env`.
The residual is the one docs/03 section 8 states: the agent runs as the
gateway's user. What keeps it from editing itself out of the gate is the core
classifier, which treats `.hermes/config.yaml`, `.hermes/agent-hooks/` and
`.hermes/hooks*` as `policy.core` and `.hermes/.env` as `account.credential`
(both human-only), provided `HERMES_HOME` ends in `.hermes`
(`/home/hermes/.hermes` on the sandboxes). ptrace against the gateway is not
closed by any hook (docs/03 section 8; HOSTED-16 case 4), and at the pinned
Hermes a hook killed by a signal counts as an allow even under `fail_closed`
(Bountify's image patches it). The install refuses a Hermes without that patch
(judged by behaviour) unless `AV_APPROVAL_ALLOW_UNPATCHED_HERMES=1` (dogfood
only). The residual, as the consent copy states it: a process on the sandbox
can kill the hook (signal) or attach to the gateway (ptrace); both are closed
by the checkpoint build (patch + ptrace_scope), not by this skill.

Under co-location (DATA-233) there is still no launcher: the sandbox gateway
runs with `NoNewPrivs=1`, so a setuid binary would be inert. The daemon runs as
its own uid (`approvald`, 10001); the hook still runs as `hermes` and reads its
token from a `hermes` file (above).

## Uncovered surfaces

What the gate does not see, or does not judge, today:

- **A hook killed by a signal** (SIGKILL, OOM, SIGTERM): empty stdout, a
  negative return code, which stock Hermes reads as an allow even under
  `fail_closed`. The shim cannot defend against its own death, and a wrapper
  process could itself be killed (and would re-key consent on a new command
  string), so there is none. Closed by the checkpoint's patch (the install
  requires it by behaviour); the widened patch (DATA-228: any non-zero exit
  without a directive, which also covers exit 1) closes the rest. The install
  prints which one this Hermes does (the exit-1 probe: `allowed` on stock
  Hermes, `blocked` on the patched checkpoint; `hermes_exit1` in `--check`).
- **Cron job scripts.** Hermes's scheduler runs a job's `script`, `monitor`
  and prerun scripts from `$HERMES_HOME/scripts/` with no `pre_tool_call` at
  all (`cron/scheduler_script.py`). Routing `cronjob(_manage)?` through the
  gate is the only control here: creating or changing a job is seen, what its
  script does at every tick is not, and a script already in place keeps
  running. A cron script runs as the gateway's user and can edit
  `config.yaml`, `.env`, the allowlist and its lock ungated; the backstop then
  blocks gated calls at the next start or within a minute, but the script
  itself is not stopped. The installer lists the scripts present at install
  and in `--check` (`cron_scripts`); the daily brief's own scripts live there.
- **MCP tools**: every Index write tool (the nine of its 14-tool MCP surface)
  is routed (R3b) and judged by the policy's `tools:` list; Index's read tools
  and any other MCP server's tools have no matcher. The list already names a class for every Index tool, so
  routing more of them is a matcher change, not a policy change.
- **Safe mode and plugin disable.** `HERMES_SAFE_MODE=1`, or removing
  `av-approval` from `plugins.enabled`, stops the plugin loading AND stops
  Hermes's `register_from_config`, so the tenant runs fully ungated with no
  record, and the backstop cannot catch its own absence. `--check` flags
  `hermes-safe-mode`; only a control-plane preflight or the checkpoint
  (DATA-228) closes it. The write that sets it is the same ungated cron-script
  route as above.
- **Native tool families with no matcher**: `computer_use`,
  `manage_connections`, `web_search`, `x_search`, `image_generate`,
  `video_generate`, `text_to_speech`, `memory` (all present at Hermes
  v2026.9.24). `computer_use` and `manage_connections` are real action
  channels; the gated list is a contract, not a discovery. R3b routes
  `web_search`, `x_search`, `image_generate`, `video_generate` and
  `text_to_speech` (the policy's `tools:` list prices them); the rest would be
  recorded under `harness.tool.unmapped` if routed.
- **Recheck cadence.** After a healthy start the backstop re-runs its check at
  most once a minute, so a mid-run plugin force-reload that drops a shell hook
  can leave up to 60 s before the next gated call is refused. A failure seen
  at start is sticky until restart.
- **Config scope.** The integrity check reads the raw `config.yaml`; Hermes
  registers from the deep-merged config. On Agent Village sandboxes the
  installer refuses a managed `/etc/hermes` scope and the defaults carry no
  hook entries, so raw and effective are the same; the check assumes that.
- **Deploy order.** An install from before DATA-234 reads as `manifest-missing`
  and blocks every gated call under enforcement until the installer re-runs:
  ship the plugin and re-run the installer in the same update.
- **Subagents.** `delegate_task` is routed (recorded, not judged); the
  2026-10-01 harness saw a child's `terminal` reach the hook, but nothing here
  proves every subagent runtime fires it.
- **Recorded, not gated.** `process(_manage)?` writes, `browser_.*`
  (including `browser_exec`), `skill_manage`, `delegate_task`,
  `cronjob(_manage)?` and `send_message` reach the facade and, from approval.md
  0.4.0 (PR #569), classify as `process.write`, `browser.exec`,
  `skill.manage`, `agent.delegate`, `cron.manage` and `message.send`. The
  day-one policy sets every one of them autonomous, with `network.call` and
  `read.web`: each call is recorded and runs, and fails closed only when the
  facade cannot be reached. On an older core the adapter passes them through
  unjudged (`{}`). `web_extract`, `web_search`, `x_search`, Index's routed
  writes and the media tools reach the facade with no classifier rule; from
  approval.md 0.4.2 the policy's `tools:` list judges them (`read.web`,
  `intent.publish.stated.index`, `opportunity.accept`, `network.call`), and an
  older core passes them through unjudged. `send_message` is not an
  agent-callable tool at Hermes v2026.9.24; its entry covers any build or
  plugin that registers it.
- **The tcp listener window** (above) and ptrace against the gateway.

## Environment

| Name | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AV_APPROVAL_ENABLED` | `.env`, else environment | Unset: nothing happens. `1/true/yes/on`: install. Anything else: kill switch (fail-open, logged; removes the gate and restores the consent keys to what the first install found). The control plane writes `1`, or `0` as the explicit off. |
| `AV_APPROVAL_ALLOW_UNPATCHED_HERMES` | `.env`, else environment | `1`: dogfood only, accept a Hermes below the `fail_closed` floor or without the signal patch, logged loudly. |
| `AV_APPROVAL_URL` | `.env` | The tenant's facade: `https://…`, `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` or `unix:<absolute path>` (above). |
| `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN_FILE` | `.env` | A file holding the AGENT credential, 0600, this user's (co-located: `$HERMES_HOME/approval/agent-token`, also the default when it exists). Read before `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN`. |
| `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN` | `.env` | The AGENT credential, the hosted dogfood's form. Never the tenant credential. |
| `AV_APPROVAL_DAEMON_UID` | `.env`, else environment | The uid that must own a loopback listener or the unix socket. Default `10001`. |
| `HERMES_ACCEPT_HOOKS=1` | `.env`, written | Headless consent, second form (the first is `hooks_auto_accept: true`). |
| `APPROVAL_HOOK_URL_ENV`, `APPROVAL_HOOK_TOKEN_ENV`, `APPROVAL_HOOK_WAIT_S` | `.env`, written | The shim's settings: `AV_APPROVAL_URL`, `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN`, `280`. |

## Identity map

`$HERMES_HOME/agent-hooks/approval-surface.json` holds `{daemon_id, tenant_id,
installed_at, overrides, prior}` with `daemon_id: null`. `overrides` lists any
dogfood override in force; `prior` is what the first install found for each key
it sets, which the kill switch restores. It sits under `agent-hooks/` so a gated
write to it is `policy.core`, but it is still a file on attendee compute:
DATA-43b must not trust it for anything but a hint. The daemon instance id is reported only
on the facade's `GET /status`, which answers the tenant credential; the
sandbox holds the agent credential. The DATA-43b follower reads it and writes
the `approval_md` identity-map row.

R3 fix round 4 (SF1, the trust boundary): what the control plane records as
routed comes from Hermes's own load and parse of the config.yaml this install
wrote. `live_selfcheck.py` runs under Hermes's interpreter, loads the file with
Hermes's `load_config` and lists the shim's specs with Hermes's
`iter_configured_hooks`, the same parse the gateway uses, and reports
`routed_entries` (distinct matchers, the first spec per matcher as Hermes keeps
it) and `routed_sha256` (those matchers sorted, one per line). `install.ts`
prints them in the gate receipt, one JSON object as the LAST line of its stdout:
`{"av_gate":{"nonce":"<nonce>","entries":<n>,"sha256":"<hex>"}}`. The nonce is
the control plane's, 16 random bytes in hex, passed in the exec's environment as
`AV_GATE_NONCE` for that one install and never logged. The control plane
accepts only that object, with its own nonce, as the last line of that exec's
stdout. An earlier line, forged or not, never counts, and any output after it
voids it. It records the result after the gateway restart is verified, and it
never reads the marker for a count. The installer does not echo config values
or tenant-controlled names onto stdout: job names from jobs.json are printed
only in a conservative shape. A
different count or list fails the self-check (`live-routed-mismatch:<n>`), so
an entry added to or removed from config.yaml by hand is caught at the next
`--check` or install. `--check` prints `routed_entries`, `routed_sha256` and the
expected two in its JSON line. An installer before R3b prints no routed line,
and the control plane then records no count. A writer inside the sandbox that
can edit config.yaml can also strip the shim entries outright: that is the
existing DATA-234 gap (cron scripts run with no hook), and this does not widen it.

## Enablement under co-location (DATA-233)

Two switches, in order. The control plane's `APPROVALD_ENFORCE` (a Railway
variable, tri-state) decides what it writes into each sandbox's `.env`; this
step reads only `AV_APPROVAL_ENABLED`:

1. `APPROVALD_ENFORCE` unset: the control plane touches no `AV_APPROVAL_*`
   line; a hand-wired hosted gate (the dogfood) keeps working.
2. `APPROVALD_ENFORCE=1`: every `.env` write sets `AV_APPROVAL_ENABLED=1`,
   `AV_APPROVAL_URL` (the daemon: `http://127.0.0.1:4682`, or the `unix:` form)
   and `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN_FILE=/home/hermes/.hermes/approval/agent-token`, and
   removes any `AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN` line, before the overlay install; this step
   then installs the gate. With a local facade the install's live fire is
   best-effort: a facade that did not answer (`live-facade-unreachable`,
   `live-hook-timed-out`) is logged and the install stands, because the shim
   blocks while the facade is unreachable. Every other problem, and any
   problem with a remote https facade, still fails the install.
3. `APPROVALD_ENFORCE=0`: every `.env` write sets `AV_APPROVAL_ENABLED=0`,
   which this step reads as the kill switch.

## Classifier rules (approval-md core, PR #569)

The core's Hermes adapter emits these classes from approval.md 0.4.0 (PR #569);
the day-one template sets each autonomous, so the call is recorded and runs. A
resident who wants one to wait makes it manual by amendment (a hook-opened
request then holds for 240 s inside the tool call). The table as the core lane
built it:

| Hermes tool (args) | Class | Template autonomy |
|---|---|---|
| `cronjob_manage` `create`/`update` with `script`, `monitor` or `no_agent`; `run` | `cron.manage` | autonomous |
| `cronjob_manage` other `create`/`update`, `pause`, `resume`, `remove` | `cron.manage` | autonomous |
| `cronjob_manage` `list` | a read class | autonomous |
| `process_manage` `write`, `submit` (stdin into a running process) | `process.write` | autonomous |
| `process_manage` `kill`, `close`, `handoff` | `process.write` | autonomous |
| `process_manage` `list`, `poll`, `log`, `wait` | a read class | autonomous |
| `browser_exec`, `browser_cdp` (code in the page) | `browser.exec` | autonomous |
| other `browser_*` (navigate, click, fill, vault) | `browser.exec` until split | autonomous |
| `skill_manage` | `skill.manage` | autonomous |
| `delegate_task` | `agent.delegate` | autonomous |
| `send_message` | `message.send` | autonomous |
| a `terminal`/`write_file`/`patch` write under `.hermes/scripts/` | `cron.manage` (or `policy.core`) | autonomous (`policy.core`: human-only) |
| a write to `.hermes/.env`, `.hermes/approval/`, `.hermes/shell-hooks-allowlist.json.lock` | `policy.core` / `account.credential` | human-only |

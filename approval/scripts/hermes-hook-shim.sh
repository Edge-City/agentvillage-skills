# VENDORED, 2026-10-01, from approval-md-hosted hermes-image/hermes-hook-shim.sh
# at commit debe4a6 (2026-09-25), under this overlay's MIT licence (LICENSE at
# the repository root), as approval-md-hosted docs/03 section 3.2 provides: the
# skill and its hook live in the public overlay and carry no Bountify logic.
#
# Changes from the origin, and nothing else (the gate logic is unchanged):
#   - this header;
#   - the by-hand defaults: the facade URL and the agent credential are read
#     from AV_APPROVAL_URL / AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN (still overridable through
#     APPROVAL_HOOK_URL_ENV / APPROVAL_HOOK_TOKEN_ENV, which
#     install/install_approval.ts also writes into $HERMES_HOME/.env), and the
#     log defaults to $HERMES_HOME/agent-hooks/approval-hook.log.
#   - DATA-234 (2026-10-02), the co-located daemon and the shim's own fatal
#     paths; the gate logic (what a facade answer means) is unchanged:
#       * by hand, the agent credential is read from the file
#         AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN_FILE names (default $HERMES_HOME/approval/agent-token
#         when that file exists), owned by this user, mode 0600, before the
#         environment variable; the value is never printed or logged;
#       * the facade URL may be `unix:<absolute socket path>` (curl
#         --unix-socket) or `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (loopback, no
#         APPROVAL_FACADE_ALLOW_HTTP needed); before every POST to a loopback
#         URL the listener must belong to the approval daemon's uid
#         (AV_APPROVAL_DAEMON_UID, default 10001), read from /proc/net/tcp{,6},
#         and a unix socket and its directory must be that uid's; anything
#         else blocks with `facade_listener_foreign`;
#       * a variable name may not start with a digit (`${1ABC:-}` is a fatal
#         "bad substitution" that would end the shell before any directive),
#         and a clock that does not print digits reads as 0 (an arithmetic
#         error is fatal too); a clock that reads 0 at start turns re-asking
#         off.
#   - 2026-10-04, the credential's header for a LOCAL facade (unix socket or
#     loopback): `Authorization`, because there the shim talks to `approval
#     serve` itself, which reads only `Authorization` (approval-md core 0.4.0,
#     src/serve/server.ts) and answered every co-located call 401
#     serve-unauthorized; no hosted supervisor stands in between to move
#     X-Approval-Authorization across. Every other facade keeps
#     X-Approval-Authorization, as before.
#   - DATA-377 (2026-10-07), the clock's unit: the hosted image's `date` is
#     uutils coreutils 0.8.0, whose `%3N` prints nine digits, so `+%s%3N` is
#     nanoseconds (19 digits) there, not milliseconds. now_ms() derives
#     milliseconds from the digit count, and ts() keeps three fraction digits.
# The Agent Village sandbox has one unix user, so the shim runs "by hand"
# there (no /opt/approval/hook-home, no setuid launcher; skills/approval/
# README.md says why). install/install_approval.ts installs this file as
# $HERMES_HOME/agent-hooks/hermes-hook-shim.sh, mode 0700.
#
# approval.md hook shim for Hermes Agent (HOSTED-10, hardened in HOSTED-13).
#
# Hermes runs this as a `pre_tool_call` shell hook. It reads the Hermes
# envelope on stdin, POSTs it to the tenant's facade (`approval serve`,
# POST /hook/hermes), and replays the facade's answer: body.stdout to stdout,
# body.stderr to stderr, exit body.exit_code (core cli-reference, "The response
# contract"). The shim decides nothing; the facade runs the core decider.
#
# FAIL CLOSED. Any transport failure, non-200 status, or missing, unparseable
# or truncated body prints the native Hermes block directive and exits 2.
# The directive on STDOUT is load-bearing: hermes-agent 0.14.0 (the Maritime
# template, v2026.5.16) has no `fail_closed` and does not treat exit 2 as a
# block; it blocks only on a stdout directive. So the shim also refuses to
# pass through a non-zero exit whose stdout carries no block directive, or an
# exit-0 stdout that is not empty and not a JSON object.
#
# TWO WAYS TO RUN, chosen by whether the hook home exists:
#
#   /opt/approval/hook-home present (the gated Hermes image, hermes-image/):
#     the shim runs as its own user (`approvalhook`), started by the root-owned
#     launcher /opt/approval/hook-launcher with a fixed environment. HOME and
#     TMPDIR are the hook home (owned by this user, mode 0700), and the facade
#     URL and the agent credential come from hook-home/facade.env (owned by
#     this user, mode 0600), written by the image's supervisor. Nothing the
#     agent can write (its PATH, its HOME, its TMPDIR, its environment) reaches
#     this process. The home or the file with any other owner or mode blocks.
#
#   no hook home (a hook installed by hand on a harness machine, HOSTED-10):
#     the facade URL and the credential are read from the environment under
#     the names below. The process runs as the agent's own user there, which
#     no shim can defend against fully; the fixed PATH, the absolute tool
#     paths, `curl -q` and the scrubbed variables close what a shim can.
#
# Settings. In the image they come from facade.env (URL, TOKEN, ALLOW_HTTP,
# WAIT_S, MAX_TIME); by hand, from the environment:
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_URL_ENV    name of the variable holding the facade base URL
#                            (default AV_APPROVAL_URL)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_TOKEN_ENV  name of the variable holding the AGENT credential
#                            (default AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_LOG        log file (default
#                            $HERMES_HOME/agent-hooks/approval-hook.log;
#                            in the image, hook-home/approval-hook.log)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_MAX_TIME   curl --max-time seconds per request (default 25;
#                            keep it under Maritime's ~30 s public-proxy cut)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_WAIT_S     total seconds to keep asking while the facade
#                            answers hook-timeout, or after the first post
#                            timed out (image default 280, at most 285; by
#                            hand default 0, one request only: set it only
#                            under an entry timeout above it, on a Hermes
#                            that honours fail_closed)
#   APPROVAL_FACADE_ALLOW_HTTP=1  accept an http:// facade URL (local fakes
#                            only); otherwise only https://, the loopback
#                            http://127.0.0.1:<port> and unix:<path> are accepted
#   AV_APPROVAL_TOKEN_FILE   by hand: a file holding the agent credential
#                            (default $HERMES_HOME/approval/agent-token when it
#                            exists); read before the environment variable
#   AV_APPROVAL_DAEMON_UID   the uid that must own a loopback listener or a
#                            unix socket facade (default 10001, the co-located
#                            daemon's)
#
# WAITING FOR A HUMAN. A facade reached through a public proxy must answer
# within the proxy's cut (about 30 s), far short of the time a human needs to
# see the question on a phone. So when the facade answers with a block naming
# `hook-timeout` (no decision yet; the question stays open and a retry of the
# same bytes adopts it), the shim waits 5 s and posts the same envelope again,
# until APPROVAL_HOOK_WAIT_S have passed since it started; then it replays the
# last block. An allow, or any other block, is replayed at once. With the
# image's 280 s the effective human window is about 280 s, inside Hermes's
# 300 s per-entry timeout.
#
# A FIRST POST THAT TIMED OUT (HOSTED-14). The facade's own hook wait must sit
# well under MAX_TIME (12 s for the 25 s default). When it does not, the first
# post can hit the ceiling (curl exit 28) after the facade has already opened
# the question, and a re-post of the same bytes adopts it. So a curl timeout
# on the FIRST post, after at least MAX_TIME, with WAIT_S above 0, enters the
# same loop a hook-timeout block does: re-post every 5 s until WAIT_S, then
# replay the facade's last block, or, when no facade answer ever arrived, block
# with the transport reason. Every other first-post failure (connection
# refused, TLS, DNS, non-200, an unparseable body) is final: nothing there
# says a question was opened. With WAIT_S=0 a first-post timeout is final too.
#
# The credential goes to curl through a config on stdin, never argv, so it
# does not appear in /proc/<pid>/cmdline. It travels as
# X-Approval-Authorization because Maritime's public proxy strips
# Authorization (image/README.md); the hosted supervisor moves it back to
# Authorization on its loopback hop. A local facade (unix socket or loopback)
# is `approval serve` with no supervisor in front, which reads Authorization
# only, so there it travels as Authorization.
#
# The log carries a timestamp, the tool name, HTTP status, exit code, the
# curl exit code of a timed-out first post, elapsed ms, the attempt, the
# refusal code and a fixed reason only. Never an envelope, a body or a value.

/**
 * Cross-day delivery state for Index opportunity cards: the one place that
 * decides whether a pending card may be shown to the resident today.
 *
 * Index keeps no delivery ledger, so the agent keeps one, in the shared state
 * file (memory/heartbeat-state.json) under OPPORTUNITY_DELIVERY_KEY:
 *
 *   { "<opportunityId>": { "firstShown": "YYYY-MM-DD", "lastShown": "YYYY-MM-DD", "count": 1 } }
 *
 * The rule, the same on every path that puts a card in front of the resident
 * (the morning brief, the opportunity drops, the afternoon follow-up's
 * "waiting on you" list and the evening card):
 *
 *   - a card never shown is eligible (on the brief, the drops and the evening
 *     card; the follow-up only re-shows cards already shown);
 *   - a card already shown is eligible again COOLDOWN_DAYS after its last
 *     showing, while it has been shown fewer than MAX_SHOWINGS times;
 *   - a card that leaves the pending list (accepted or rejected) is finished:
 *     its entry is dropped on the next successful, complete read of that list,
 *     so the same id coming back later counts as new;
 *   - a card with `negotiating: true` is not waiting on the resident, so it is
 *     never offered (see awaitsResident).
 *
 * Dates are the village day (villageDate, Asia/Kolkata) that every caller
 * already uses for `deliveredToday`. The per-day `deliveredToday` dedupe is
 * unchanged and is applied by each caller before this rule.
 *
 * A run dated before the real village day (a manual rerun with `--date`) is
 * read-only for delivery state: it never writes this log or `deliveredToday`
 * (isBackDated), and it measures "future" entries against the real day, so it
 * cannot delete live entries.
 *
 * Known limit: a showing is recorded when the card is handed to the agent for
 * delivery (the drop, the evening card and the follow-up before they print
 * it, the brief's send before the agent replies), not when the message is
 * confirmed delivered, because no delivery confirmation exists anywhere in
 * the chain. A send that fails after that point still costs the card its
 * COOLDOWN_DAYS wait and one of its MAX_SHOWINGS showings. So does a message
 * the model leaves `[SILENT]` because the resident's stated Preferences
 * plainly ask never to get that kind of message (the prompts allow nothing
 * narrower, such as a time of day; OV-251 S2).
 *
 * Everything here is pure. Callers read and write the state file themselves
 * and replace only OPPORTUNITY_DELIVERY_KEY, so sibling keys are never
 * touched.

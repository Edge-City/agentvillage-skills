/**
 * The evening outcome ask (DATA-42, ruling R2): the trigger's half.
 *
 * The 14:00 follow-up announces each newly accepted connection once and
 * records the village date it did (`negotiationSummary.announcedOn`). Two or
 * more days later, the 19:00 evening job asks about ONE such connection that
 * has not been asked yet:
 *
 *   Did you and <name> meet? Reply met, not useful, or missed.
 *
 * When none is due, or Index cannot be read, or the due person's name does
 * not clean, the evening job falls back to its reminder (ask-questions.ts) and
 * the subject stays due.
 *
 * Hand-off to the av-events plugin (plugins/av-events/_outcome_ask.py): when
 * the trigger wakes the model with the question it writes a stage file,
 * `av-events/proactive/outcome-ask-evening.json` (0600, ids only, no name and
 * no text). The plugin arms it on the evening run's reply and, once Hermes's
 * ledger says the message was delivered or queued, emits `outcome.asked` and
 * records the subject in `av-events/proactive/outcome-asked.json`. Only that
 * ledger makes a subject "asked": a run that replies `[SILENT]`, fails to
 * deliver, or never reaches the plugin leaves it due for the next evening,
 * up to MAX_ATTEMPTS (two) evenings. When the plugin would not record (blank AV_EVENTS_TOKEN,
 * AV_EVENTS_ENABLED off, outcome_ask or post_llm_call disabled) or its asked ledger is unreadable,
 * nothing could record an ask, and the evening asks nobody
 * (proactive.ts outcomePluginOff, readAskedIds).

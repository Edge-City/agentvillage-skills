/**
 * The pending-opportunity alert (DATA-430, overlay half): one Telegram line,
 * within the hour, for each opportunity that newly turned pending for the
 * resident, so a pending window never runs out with nobody told.
 *
 * The hourly job `Edge — pending opportunity` (install_index.ts, 20 * * * *)
 * runs it through the proactive trigger (proactive.ts `pending`), which reads
 * the job's delivery window first (job-settings.ts: 08:00 to 22:00 village
 * time by default): a run outside it never gets here, so it writes nothing. It
 * has no once-a-day mark: the per-card ledger below is the only gate.
 *
 *   - Reads Index's pending list through the path the opportunity drops use
 *     (listOpportunitiesFromMcp, INDEX_API_KEY): no new credential, no
 *     control-plane call.
 *   - A card is newly pending when it is on that list (status `pending`, or
 *     no status: the read asks for pending only), it awaits the resident
 *     (delivery-state.ts awaitsResident: not `negotiating`), and its id is not
 *     in the ledger below.
 *   - The ledger is PENDING_ALERTS_KEY in memory/heartbeat-state.json:
 *
 *       "pendingAlerts": { "<opportunityId>": { "firstSeen": "<ISO>", "lastSeen": "<ISO>", "alertedAt": "<ISO>" | null } }
 *
 *     `firstSeen` is the first in-window run that saw the card pending;
 *     `lastSeen` the latest run that saw it on the list (an entry written
 *     before `lastSeen` existed reads it as `firstSeen`); `alertedAt` is
 *     when it was handed to the agent to send, null while it waits for a slot
 *     (at most MAX_ALERTS_PER_RUN per run, the oldest `firstSeen` first; the
 *     rest go at the next run).
 *   - FIRST RUN on a box (the key absent): every card pending now is recorded
 *     as already alerted (`alertedAt` = now) and nothing is sent, so the
 *     install never sends the backlog of cards that were pending before this
 *     job existed. The key is written even when the list is empty.
 *   - Pruning (DATA-430 fix round 1, S1). Index's list is lossy: it keeps the
 *     newest card per counterparty, hides a pending card its owner already
 *     committed to, and looks back over about 150 rows (agentvillage-data
 *     runbook, DATA-248 D1), so a card missing from one read may still be
 *     pending and come back. Absence is therefore weak evidence:
 *       - an entry absent from a complete read is dropped only when its
 *         `lastSeen` is more than PRUNE_GRACE_HOURS old; a card back within
 *         the grace keeps its entry and is not alerted again;
 *       - a read with no rows at all prunes nothing (a transient empty answer
 *         must not re-arm every card);
 *       - a cut-short read never drops an entry for being absent
 *         (delivery-state.ts PendingListing);
 *       - positive evidence drops at once, even on a cut-short read: a card
 *         seen `negotiating` is no longer waiting on the resident, so if it
 *         turns pending again later it counts as new and is alerted again.
 *   - A card is recorded as alerted when it is handed to the agent, before
 *     delivery, as the drops record their showing: a send that fails after
 *     that loses the alert, and never repeats it.
 *   - A failed Index read writes nothing and is silent (`index-unavailable`).
 *
 * `respondBy`: Index serves no deadline on any route the box uses today
 * (the recorded reply, the index-mcp fixture under tests/fixtures, verified
 * 2026-10-03; Index main 61b71ac read 2026-10-09), so it is null in
 * production. The parser (build-daily-brief-context.ts listedCard,
 * parseExpiresAt) takes a row's ISO `expiresAt` when one appears (the field
 * name is the control plane's assumption); any other shape or absence is
 * null. Never computed or invented. The words are RESPOND_BY_WORDS.
 *
 * As a script (`bun pending-alert.ts [--state-file <path>] [--read-only]`,
 * from $HERMES_HOME): takes the state lock, prints `[SILENT]` (the reason on
 * stderr) or the Script Output the trigger would give the model:
 * `{ agentName, job, cards: [{ name, profileUrl, appUrl, acceptUrl,
 * opportunityId, firstSeen, respondBy }] }`. It ignores the delivery window.
 * `--read-only` picks as a real run would and writes nothing.

 * cleaned and scanned:
 *
 *   - cleanName(): a person's name as a plain display name, or null.
 *   - cleanText(): an organiser announcement or a fact the overlay computed
 *     (a time, the weather) as one plain line, or null.
 *   - cleanTitle(): text a non-organiser can write or that is read back from
 *     a store (event titles and venues, the resident's notes from memory
 *     files, signals from Index) as one plain line, stricter, or null.
 *   - cronScanHit(): the patterns Hermes's cron prompt scanner blocks a run on.
 *   - connectionsUrl(): the Connections link the brief always carries.

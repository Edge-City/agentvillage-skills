/**
 * DATA-314 B1-fix F2: a stale lock that cannot be removed must end the wait,
 * the deadline holds on every iteration, and every iteration yields so the
 * trigger's own hard stop can fire. Each case runs in a child process the
 * parent kills after a few seconds: a wait that spins without yielding cannot
 * be stopped from inside its own process (that was the bug).

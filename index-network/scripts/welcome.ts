/**
 * DATA-357: the resident's first welcome, grounded in their own Index intents.
 *
 *   bun skills/index-network/scripts/welcome.ts [--home DIR] [--draft]
 *
 * One Index read (`list_intents`, an unrouted read through the shared MCP
 * client) and a fixed template, so the text is the same every time for the
 * same intents:
 *
 *   - intents: up to three of the resident's active intents by title, one
 *     line each, what the agent will do with them, and how to add or change
 *     them (the app's Intents page, or just tell me);
 *   - no active intents: the app's three Context questions, and a promise to
 *     turn the answers into intents the resident confirms;
 *   - no key, Index unreachable or an answer it cannot read: the welcome
 *     without the list, saying it will catch up in the morning brief.
 *
 * It never creates, changes or publishes an intent.
 *
 * One welcome per tenant. `memory/welcome-state.json` under `$HERMES_HOME`
 * (`{"welcomeSent":true,"sentAt":"<ISO-8601>"}`) is the marker the control
 * plane's Telegram greeting and the overlay's AGENTS.md welcome gate already
 * share, and the installer keeps across updates (install/welcome_state.ts).
 * By default the script prints WELCOME_ALREADY_SENT when the marker is set;
 * otherwise it claims the marker (created exclusively, so two runs at once
 * cannot both win) and prints the welcome. `--draft` prints the welcome and
 * never reads or writes the marker, for a caller that delivers and marks the
 * welcome itself.
 *
 * Stdout is exactly the message (the agent sends it verbatim). By default
 * nothing is written to stderr on any normal path: Hermes's `terminal` tool
 * hands the agent both streams. With `--draft` only, one line follows on
 * stderr after the message, for the caller that delivers it (the control
 * plane's Telegram greeting, which records welcome.sent@1 from it): exactly
 *
 *   {"welcome":1,"fallback":"none|questions|unreachable","intents_listed":<0..3>}
 *
 * `fallback` is the branch the text took (`none`: intents listed;
 * `questions`: no active intents; `unreachable`: no key, Index unreachable,
 * or the script failed and printed the unreachable text), and
 * `intents_listed` the number of `- ` intent lines printed (1..3 for `none`,
 * else 0). It never carries text. It always exits 0.

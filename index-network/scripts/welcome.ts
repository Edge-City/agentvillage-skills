/**
 * DATA-357: the resident's first welcome, grounded in their own Index intents.
 *
 *   bun skills/index-network/scripts/welcome.ts [--home DIR] [--draft]
 *
 * One Index read (`list_intents`, an unrouted read through the shared MCP
 * client) and a fixed template, so the text is the same every time for the
 * same intents:
 *
 *   - intents: up to three of the resident's active intents by title, one
 *     line each (whole up to TITLE_MAX code points, else cut at a word
 *     boundary, and cut further only when the three together would take the
 *     welcome past WELCOME_MAX_CHARS: fitTitles), what the agent will do with
 *     them, and how to add or change them (the app's Intents page, or just
 *     tell me);
 *   - no active intents: the app's three Context questions, and a promise to
 *     turn the answers into intents the resident confirms;
 *   - no key, Index unreachable or an answer it cannot read: the welcome
 *     without the list, saying it will catch up in the morning brief.
 *
 * DATA-412 / DATA-416: the seed. When no welcome was sent yet (the welcome
 * marker below, read in both modes), that read succeeds and lists no active
 * intent, the resident selected intentions at signup (`## Selected
 * intentions` in the app's profile at `$HERMES_HOME/USER.md`:
 * selectedIntentions), and the seed marker `memory/welcome-seed.json` does
 * not exist, the script claims that marker (created exclusively, so the
 * creates run once per box, in both modes) and creates up to three of those
 * lines at once, each with `create_intent(description=<the line's text>,
 * sourceType="agentvillage")` and nothing else; a line that repeats another
 * one, or any intent Index lists whatever its status, is skipped.
 * `AV_WELCOME_SEED_MODE=paused` pauses each one it created (`pause_intent`).
 * It then lists the intents again (the creates leave it
 * WELCOME_RELIST_RESERVE_MS of the budget) and the welcome names the seeded
 * ones first ("From what you told me at signup, ..."); the marker then gets
 * `done`. A run that finds the marker already there, whatever its first list
 * showed (another run's creates may have landed only in part), waits while it
 * lacks `done` and then lists again, so its welcome shows what was seeded.
 * Nothing of the resident's but the selected texts is sent, and no text is
 * logged. It never changes, publishes or archives an intent it did not
 * create.
 *
 * Known limits (DATA-416). In paused mode, a create that landed but answered
 * too late, or whose `pause_intent` failed, stays published while the trailer
 * counts it failed and the paused welcome leaves it out (paused mode is not
 * used in production). The seed marker is claimed by an exclusive create and
 * then written, not in one atomic step: a run that reads it in between finds
 * it empty, does not wait, and may list only part of the seed (theoretical:
 * a window of microseconds).
 *
 * One welcome per tenant. `memory/welcome-state.json` under `$HERMES_HOME`
 * (`{"welcomeSent":true,"sentAt":"<ISO-8601>"}`) is the marker the control
 * plane's Telegram greeting and the overlay's AGENTS.md welcome gate already
 * share, and the installer keeps across updates (install/welcome_state.ts).
 * By default the script prints WELCOME_ALREADY_SENT when the marker is set;
 * otherwise it claims the marker (created exclusively, so two runs at once
 * cannot both win) and prints the welcome. `--draft` prints the welcome and
 * never writes the marker, for a caller that delivers and marks the welcome
 * itself; it reads it only to skip the seed once a welcome was sent (the seed
 * marker is claimed in both modes).
 *
 * Stdout is exactly the message (the agent sends it verbatim). By default
 * nothing is written to stderr on any normal path: Hermes's `terminal` tool
 * hands the agent both streams. With `--draft` only, one line follows on
 * stderr after the message, for the caller that delivers it (the control
 * plane's Telegram greeting, which records welcome.sent@1 from it): exactly
 *
 *   {"welcome":1,"fallback":"none|questions|unreachable","intents_listed":<0..3>,"intents_seeded":<0..3>,"seed_failed":<0..3>}
 *
 * `fallback` is the branch the text took (`none`: intents listed, seeded
 * ones included; `questions`: no active intents; `unreachable`: no key,
 * Index unreachable, or the script failed and printed the unreachable text),
 * `intents_listed` the number of `- ` intent lines printed (1..3 for `none`,
 * else 0), `intents_seeded` the intents this run created (and, paused mode,
 * paused) and `seed_failed` the lines it meant to seed and could not (both 0
 * when nothing was attempted). It never carries text. It always exits 0.
